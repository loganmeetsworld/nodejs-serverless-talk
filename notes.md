## What is serverless?

<!-- 5 min
* actually misnomer, very serverfull

## Why is Node.js uniquely suited for handling these problems? 
Core node principles are helpful for functional programming and AWS Lambda 
We could use Python, but we chose node. 
- Single Functionality
- Substack patterns
- Small surface area
- Promises

<!-- Prompt: Node can be a great ally to any ops engineer. This talk will dive into AWS lambdas, a.k.a serverless functions and show how Node can be used to build a small application running on AWS Lambda with the help of the a new deployment model called SAM (AWS Serverless Application Model). We will also discuss testing (with Mocha and Chai) as well as moving towards purely functional javascript and some of its concepts (immutability and point-free programming). -->
